function [outdata]=BOOSTRP_SPATIAL_GLIDER_ESTIMATES(lats, lons, int_abc_in, yes_no)

% This function recodes glider acoustic data from a deployment into binned
% data on a foixed but user definable size spatial grid. 
% The goal is to generate a smoothed glider deployment where over sampling
% in regions where the glider was stuck, or resampled when areas were
% sampled more than once could provide a bias in the data set.

% The output of this can be used as necessary for example by bootstrapping
% to generate a biomass density estimate that breaks up the spatial
% autocorrelation. 

% Inputs are the latitudes and longitude of each profile as well as the
% integrated ABCs for each profile. yes_no= 1 = print; 0 = no print

% Load the data of the gridded acoustic abc data that is in profiles

% Requires M_Map for mapping https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html
% Requires nearxy.m
